# Scheduling_Project

The problem of the planting problem is given as follows:
  - given a set of fields with known variety of rice to be planted
  - each variety has a different reaction to temperature when growing, which
  means that once the grow date of a field is set, the mature date can be
  calculated based on the weather prediction
  - however, there is a hard deadline on which all fields must be harvested, no
  matter the growing state of that field
  - as a result, the scheduling of plantation is vital to increase the overall
  productivity of all the fields
  - the planting operation is limited by the number of planters
